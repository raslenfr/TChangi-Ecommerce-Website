# TChangi: E-Commerce Barter Website 🛒💰

I’m thrilled to share **TChangi**, my first e-commerce barter website!  
TChangi (also called **Chanji**) allows users to **exchange items they no longer need** for items they want, promoting **sustainability, savings, and community connections**. Every item traded gets a **second life instead of being thrown away**, making everyone a winner! 🌟
